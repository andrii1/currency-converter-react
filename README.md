## Currency converter in React
This app uses create-react-app, [exchangeratesapi.io](exchangeratesapi.io)

What it does:
- Conversion of an amount between a pair of chosen currencies
- Handling of loading and error state, in case API is slow or returns an error
- Ability to search for the currencies you want to choose between

It uses Context, just for example of state management in React.
